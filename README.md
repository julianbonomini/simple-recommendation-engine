# Simple recommendation engine

This reposotory is meant to be a guide for those who are looking to start a really simple recommendation engine based on users. This engine is using Pearson correlation coefficient as a similarity metric. Be aware that this is not fully complete and the dataset is small, probably you will need to change things to adapt this engine for larger datasets.

### Dependencies

No dependencies!

### To run the project
```sh
$ python main.py
```

### More about Pearson correlation coefficient
